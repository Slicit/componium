/* What can be attached to a pin, and what it can be told.
 *
 * Three types, which is what an ESP32 usefully drives: a dimmed output, an
 * addressable strip, and a switch. See ADR 0007 for why there is no build time
 * selector between them yet, and docs/cip.md for the configuration that says
 * which is on which pin.
 *
 * The types are what this build contains. The devices are what a configuration
 * says is plugged into it, and that includes the physical facts about the thing
 * on the end of the wire: how long it takes to do anything, how long it takes
 * to get there, and what it should be doing when nobody is talking to it. Those
 * used to be #defines, which is why the fan's declared 1.2 second dead time has
 * been a guess since the day it was written: measuring it meant editing this
 * file and reflashing, so nobody ever did.
