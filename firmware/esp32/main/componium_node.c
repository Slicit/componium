/*
 * Componium instrument node for ESP32, using ESP-IDF.
 *
 * Implements the Componium Instrument Protocol (docs/cip.md) over UDP and
 * drives a PWM output, which is enough for a fan, a dimmable light, a mister,
 * or anything else that takes a 0 to 1 level.
 *
 * The design borrows ESPHome's ergonomics and rejects its control path. See
 * docs/adr/0002-esp32-node.md: ESPHome talks to Home Assistant at 100 to 300ms
 * with non-deterministic jitter, which is fine for home automation and useless
 * for landing a cue on a frame.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE IN THIS FILE
 *
 * The watchdog is not optional and does not depend on the network being
 * healthy, on the conductor being correct, or on anyone remembering to send a
 * stop. If heartbeats stop arriving for CIP_WATCHDOG_MS the output goes to its
 * safe value. That is the only thing standing between a crashed conductor and
 * a fan running all night.
 *
 * STATUS: written, not compiled. No ESP32 and no ESP-IDF toolchain were
 * available. Treat it as a careful draft rather than as working firmware.
