// The rule this obeys, and the reason it is safe: the studio edits *the rig
// file*, not a copy of it. There is still one place that says what is on the
// end of every wire, and it is still a file anybody can open in an editor. A
// studio that kept its own idea of the hardware would be a studio that
// disagrees with the conductor, and the conductor is the one holding the mains.
//
// The consequence worth stating plainly, because the page states it too: the
// conductor reads the rig when it starts. Saving here changes what the next
// show will do, not what a running one is doing.

// handleRigSave replaces the rig with what the page sent.
