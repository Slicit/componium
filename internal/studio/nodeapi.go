// Short lived connections on purpose. The studio holds no node open: it dials,
// asks, and hangs up. A board is driven by the conductor, and a studio that
// kept a socket to one would be a second thing heartbeating it, which is the
// shape of every bug this project has had this week.
//
// The secret is never stored here. It arrives with the request, is used for one
// exchange, and goes. Where a board is already in a rig, the rig file has it;
// where it is not, the person configuring it has it in their hand.
