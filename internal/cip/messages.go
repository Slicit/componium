// Package cip implements the Componium Instrument Protocol: how the conductor
// talks to instruments that are not in this process.
//
// Everything is UDP, including cues. docs/cip.md originally specified
// WebSocket for control, which was written before anyone considered what it
// would mean on an ESP32. See ADR 0005: a websocket needs a TCP stack and
// framing on a device that has neither to spare, and TCP would let a stalled
// curve stream delay a cue behind it. UDP with an explicit acknowledgement and
// retry is about twenty lines, has no head of line blocking, and fails in ways
// that are easy to see.
//
// Three kinds of traffic, with different needs:
//
//   - Control (hello, cue, safe) is rare, must arrive, and is acknowledged.
//   - Curve frames are frequent and disposable. A dropped frame is superseded
//     20ms later, so retransmitting one is worse than useless.
//   - Heartbeats are frequent, unacknowledged, and their absence is the
//     message.
