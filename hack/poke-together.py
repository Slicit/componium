"""Drive every output on one board at once, over authenticated CIP 0.3.

The companion to poke.py, which drives one output at a time and is the one to
reach for with a multimeter in hand. Both speak the same authenticated 0.3
through hack/cip.py. The question here is the one a single output cannot
answer: not "does the fan spin", which poke.py settles, but "do the fan and
both strips move together, and does each strip get the colour meant for it".

    python3 poke-together.py 192.168.1.75            # everything
    python3 poke-together.py 192.168.1.75 hello      # just look
    python3 poke-together.py 192.168.1.75 rollcall   # one movement

The secret is found rather than typed: $COMPONIUM_CIP_SECRET if it is set,
otherwise ~/.componium/node-secret. Pass --secret to override, or give it
as a second argument as before. Which one was used is printed every run.

Colour is the reason this is worth doing by eye rather than by counter. Two
strips both lit is not evidence: two strips lit in *different* colours, then
swapping colours in step, is. Almost every way of getting the addressing wrong
ends with both strips showing the same thing, and the counters cannot see that
because from the board's side the frame was applied perfectly.

Five movements, each failing differently on purpose:

  rollcall   Each light alone in its own colour, everything else dark. This is
             the one that maps an announced index onto a strip you can point
             at. Run it first on a board you have just wired.
  contrast   Every light at once, each a different colour, held still. Side by
             side, which is where a colour that is nearly right looks wrong.
  swap       The colours rotate between the strips, all in one datagram. Two
             strips changing at visibly different moments means the bundle is
             not doing its job.
  bundle     Fifty frames a second: the fan ramps while every strip sweeps the
             hue circle, each one a different distance around it, so no two are
             ever the same colour.
  watchdog   The heartbeats stop. Everything should go dark and go still
             within 300ms, without being told to.

The counters come off the board's own status page afterwards, so the report is
what the board did rather than what this sent.

Two things to know before trusting your eyes. A strip that names the wrong
primary is not a plain WS2812, and the answer is that strip's `order` in the
studio rather than anything in this file: the board honours it as of
firmware v0.1.0-alpha.1-98, and ignored it in every build before that, so an
older board will keep showing the wrong colour however it is configured.
And a node keeps a single replay counter for the whole board rather than one
per sender, so anything else talking to it during a run, the studio's Boards
page included, silences this script for the rest of the run. See
LOGBOOK/notes.md.
