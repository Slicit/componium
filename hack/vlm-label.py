"""Label one film frame with a vision model, for --vlm-command.

    compose.py film.mkv --vlm-command "hack/vlm-label.py"

The composer hands this an image path and reads labels from stdout, one per
line. That contract is the whole interface; this script is one implementation
of it and nothing in the composer knows it exists.

Configured entirely by environment, because --vlm-command is a single string
and threading options through it would mean inventing a second command line:

    COMPONIUM_VLM_HOST   default http://gaming.home:14242
    COMPONIUM_VLM_MODEL  default qwen3-vl:8b
    COMPONIUM_VLM_DEBUG  set to print the raw reply on stderr

The vocabulary below is not a description of the world. It is exactly the set
of words the composer can already act on, plus the ones this feature adds, and
nothing else: a model that answers "pyroclastic flow" is producing a word that
maps to no instrument, which is the same as saying nothing while costing five
seconds. So the prompt names the list and the parser rejects everything off it.

physical effects — fans, lights, water, smoke — for the audience watching it.

Report only what is plainly visible IN THIS FRAME. You are not describing the
story, guessing what happens next, or inferring from context.

Reply with exactly four lines and nothing else. No explanation.

EFFECTS: <comma-separated words from the list below, or the word none>
WATER: <yes if any sea, lake, river or large stretch of water is visible
        anywhere in the frame, however calm, otherwise no>
SCENE: <calm or active>
SEEN: <one plain sentence describing what is in the frame and what is
       happening, as you would tell someone who cannot see it>

The only permitted effect words:

  explosion  a fireball or blast going off. Not a fire that is merely burning.
  lightning  a lightning bolt, or a flash so bright it lights the whole scene.
  fire       visible flames. Not smoke alone, not glowing embers.
  smoke      a plume or cloud of smoke. Not fog, mist, haze or low cloud.
  dust       a burst of dust or debris thrown into the air by an impact.
  splash     water thrown into the air: spray, a breaking wave, something
             hitting water. The water must be moving.
  rain       rain visibly falling.
  wind       air visibly moving things: trees or grass bent over, hair or
             clothing pulled, spray torn sideways, debris carried past.
             Not a small creature flying under its own power, not a
             character walking, not water flowing downhill.
  carried    the view itself is travelling fast through air: riding,
             driving, flying, falling. Answer this about the camera and
             not about anything in the frame. A bird crossing the shot is
             not carried; being the bird is.

If none of those are plainly visible, answer exactly: EFFECTS: none

SCENE is about how much is happening to the audience, not how pretty it is:

  calm    conversation, stillness, scenery, walking, slow camera movement.
  active  impact, fast motion, combat, chaos, a vehicle at speed, destruction.

Most frames of most films are calm. Answer active only when something is
actually happening."""


# What the film is, added to the prompt when somebody has said.

# once as the reason. A model told it is watching a war film will find
# explosions in a frame that has none if it is allowed to reason that way, which
# is the same fault as emphasising a label and getting more of that label.
#
# What it is for is the other half: "a man in a military uniform in a dimly lit
# room" is what a model says when it does not know it is looking at a hangar
# deck, and a person reading three thousand of those cannot tell the film apart
# from any other film.

About this film, from the person who set it up:

  %s

That is background for the SEEN line only. Use it to name what you are looking

It is not evidence. EFFECTS, WATER and SCENE are about this frame and nothing
else. A film being a war film is not a reason to report an explosion, and a
film set at sea is not a reason to report water. If the frame does not show it,
it is not there."""

# water on a desert frame, and turned a crab kicking up sand back into a
# splash. Asked last, every label matches what the model gives with no sentence
# at all — and the sentence itself is better, because it is describing what was
# decided rather than deciding it. It says the crabs are kicking up sand.

# Water is asked separately because it is not an effect and the prompt spends
# its first paragraphs insisting on effects.

# Listed among them it was simply never reported: a still sea on the horizon is
