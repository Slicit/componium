# fix-effect-parity · the library and the timeline say the same thing

## Intent

Reported as: insert Strobe at the playhead, get one light event with no
intensity and no points. Three separate faults, all of them the same shape, all
of them a preset being mistranslated on the way into a track.

## What was actually wrong

**A repeating shape collapsed into one cue.** A cue track was assumed to want
one dose, which is right for a fogger (you tell it how hard and for how long,
and the shape inside the burst is its business) and wrong for a lamp that can
flash. `stutter(12)` is not a two second flash held at full. It is twelve
flashes, and one of them is a different preset wearing the same name.

**Channels came from the kind, not the track.** `channelsOf` read `track.points`
and nothing else, so a cue track, which has no points at all, always fell
through to the kind's default names. The composer writes light events as
`h`/`s`/`i`; the default is `r`/`g`/`b`. Every insert into `light.event` landed
in a vocabulary the rest of the track did not speak, which is why the editor
had no intensity to offer: it offers the lanes the track uses, and the new cue
used different ones.

**A level was written into a hue.** The peak went into every channel a track
named. On `r`/`g`/`b` that is white at full and defensible. On `h`/`s`/`i` it is
a saturated red, and a Fade up on `light.ambient` swept the hue through the
spectrum on its way to bright.

And one hole the same audit found: five motion presets were offered for cue
tracks, where `build` correctly refuses to invent a verb for a platform. The
picker offered them; the insert declined; nothing happened and nothing said so.

## The rule

**Anything the picker offers must insert, into the track it was offered for,
something that keeps the shape's pulses and lands in that track's own
channels.**

Four parts, in the order they bite:

1. **Pulses survive.** A cue track gets one cue per stretch of the shape above
   zero. One gesture stays one cue; twelve pulses arrive as twelve.
2. **Channels are the track's.** `channelsOf` reads points *and* cues. What is
   already written in a track decides what gets written into it.
3. **The number is a level.** Where a track names one (`i`, `intensity`,
   `output`), the shape drives that alone and the rest hold what the curve had
   under the playhead. Where it names none, every channel takes it.
4. **Offered means buildable.** A kind with no cue action gets no cue presets.
   Silence in the picker beats a button that does nothing.
5. **Offered means faithful.** Buildable is not the same as survivable. A cue
   carries when, for how long, and how hard; everything else in a shape is
   lost. So a shape becomes cues only when that is all it ever was: a preset
   that declares an action is an event, and the instrument owns the envelope
   once the burst starts; a preset without one is a level shape, and the only
   level shape a cue track can carry is a rhythm, several pulses arriving as
   several cues. Flatten a single one and what is left is "on at full for
   three seconds", which is not a fade up.

## Where the rule lives

`web/src/core/parity.test.ts`, not here and not in a comment. It walks every
preset against every kind it declares against both track types and asserts all
four, in both directions. Adding a preset, a kind, an action or a channel
vocabulary means the test walks it without anybody remembering to.

The both-directions part is the load bearing half. Asserting only that what is
offered can be built is satisfied by offering nothing, so it also asserts that
everything *not* offered would genuinely have been refused.

## The clause that was missing, and came back a day later

Clauses 1 to 4 shipped first and the report came straight back: fade and
firelight on a light event track produce a stripe at full brightness. Correct,
and the same fault one step along. The rule asked whether a preset could be
built into a track. It did not ask whether the preset was still itself
afterwards, and a ramp flattened to its peak is not.

Three presets turned out to be events wearing no label, so they now declare
one: Flash, Impact and Gust. The rest of the light, wind and shake library is
level shapes, which a dimmer can hold and a cue track cannot. A `light.event`
track is offered Flash and Strobe. A `light.ambient` track is still offered all
seven, because a dimmer can do all seven.

Worth saying plainly, since it is what the first pass got wrong: **a test that
walks an index still only asks the question you wrote down.**

## Decisions

- **2026-09-01 · One cue per pulse rather than a `repeats` flag on the preset.**
  A flag is a second place to be wrong, and it would have to be set correctly on
  every future preset by hand. The shape already knows: a stretch above zero is
  a pulse, and counting them needs no new field. Single gesture presets come out
  of it unchanged, which is why nothing else in the library moved.
- **2026-09-01 · No `motion` action invented.** `ACTION_BY_KIND` has no entry
  for motion because there is no truthful verb for a platform; you do not tell
  it to "move", you tell it where to be. The fix was to stop offering motion
  presets on cue tracks, not to make up a word for an instrument to ignore.
- **2026-09-01 · `action` means what it always said it meant.** The field was
  documented as "an action name, for the devices driven by events rather than
  levels" and was set on foggers and misters only, while `actionForKind` let
  every other kind's presets onto a cue track through the back door. Making
  three presets declare it, rather than adding a second flag beside it, is the
  smaller change and the truer one: there was never a missing concept, only
  three entries that had not used the one that was there.
- **2026-09-01 · Lightning stays a curve.** It is conceptually two strikes and
  mechanically one pulse: the gaps between them sit at 0.1 and 0.05 rather than
  at zero, which is the afterglow that makes it read as lightning. Zeroing them
  to win two cues would trade the shape for the count on the track where the
  shape actually works.
- **2026-09-01 · The base holds colour, and only colour.** Feeding the track's
  value under the playhead into the level channel too would have turned every
  insert into a blend with the curve it replaces. An existing test caught that
  within a minute of it being written, which is the argument for the test file
  in one sentence.

## Verification

`web/src/core/parity.test.ts`, which walks the preset index rather than a list
somebody wrote out by hand: every preset the picker offers is inserted and the
result asserted, and every preset it withholds is asserted to genuinely fail.
Both directions, because "everything offered works" is satisfied by offering
nothing.
