# feat-score-editing — hand editing a track to finish the render

Status: **active.** Recorded 2026-08-29 as deferred and not started. Most
of it was built over the following week without this file being touched;
the record was corrected on 2026-09-07 and the correction is in the
Decisions log. Everything below describes 2026-08-29 and is kept, because
the analysis in it is what shaped the work.

## Intent

Real editing of the generated score, not just correcting one cue at a time.
The composer's output is a first pass; finishing a film means shaping it by
hand. That wants, roughly:

- **Smoothing** a curve, or a stretch of one, without redrawing it point by
  point. The light curves in particular come out of the analysis noisy at the
  scale of a few frames, and the fix is a filter with a handle on it, not a
  hundred small edits.
- **Selecting a time range across tracks**, then cutting, copying and pasting
  it. Effects that belong together — a flash, its wind gust, the rumble under
  it — are authored together and should move together.
- **Transforming a selection**: scale levels, shift in time, stretch, reverse,
  thin out cues that are too dense.
- **Reusable light effects.** A flicker, a pulse, a slow wash-to-red are
  patterns an operator will want to name once and apply repeatedly.

## What exists today

The studio's inspector edits a single cue: time, duration, parameters, saved
back through the same parser `componium play` uses, so nothing can be written
that the player would refuse. Tracks can be muted and soloed. That is the whole
of it — everything above is new.

## Why it is tricky

- **Two different shapes of data.** Cues are discrete events with a start and
  optionally a hold; curves are sampled control points. "Copy this range" means
  something different for each, and a selection usually spans both.
- **Undo.** Range operations are not survivable without it, and there is no
  undo in the studio at all right now. This probably has to come first.
- **Smoothing must not violate what the score guarantees.** Duty cycles,
  maximum continuous run, the calm budget and the latency-compensated start and
  stop of every span are properties of the score, not decorations on it. A
  filter that rounds a corner can quietly extend a span past a device's
  `MaxContinuous`, and the machine that pays for that is one that moves a
  person. Every edit path needs to run back through validation, and the editor
  should refuse rather than warn.
- **Where the truth lives.** If a hand edit is a diff against the analysis,
  re-running the composer can keep it; if it overwrites, "rebuild all" silently
  destroys a day of work. The current library has a Rebuild button next to
  every film, so this is a real hazard, not a hypothetical one. Decide this
  before writing any editing UI.

## Decisions

- 2026-09-07 · The status in this file was wrong. Recorded on 2026-08-29 as
  deferred and not started, and by 2026-09-07 most of it had been built without
  the file being touched: undo and redo, multi-select, spans, split, duplicate,
  copy and paste, and a context menu over the whole surface with a keyboard of
  its own. "What exists today" above describes 2026-08-29.
- 2026-09-07 · Two of its questions are still open and still the right
  questions. What smoothing is allowed to do to a score's guarantees, and
  whether a hand edit is a diff against the analysis or an overwrite of it. The
  library still has a Rebuild button beside every film, so the second one is a
  live hazard rather than a hypothetical.
