"""Generate a Componium score from a film.

Composer v1 extracts four signals:

  LFE energy -> shake.  Sub-bass maps almost directly onto rumble, and it is
  nearly free to compute.  Explosions, engines and thunder all live here.

  Average frame colour -> ambient light.  This is what Ambilight does.  It is
  one ffmpeg filter and it demonstrates the whole pipeline end to end.

  Subtitle descriptions -> cues.  SDH subtitles already carry timestamped,
  human authored labels for exactly the events a rig wants: [thunder rumbles].

  Scene cuts -> curve snapping, so effects do not bleed across a hard cut.

The output is a proposal for a human to refine, never something to play
unreviewed.  See LOGBOOK/features/feat-composer.md.
