"""Analysing part of a film instead of all of it.

A feature takes tens of minutes to analyse and the run is worth nothing until
it finishes, so the studio cuts one into pieces it can record as they land. A
piece is a time range rather than a slice of file: the prepared copy of a
feature runs to gigabytes, and writing a second copy of it to disk in order to
read it in pieces costs more than the problem is worth.

Two things make a range more than an ffmpeg seek.

The first is warmup. Motion is measured by comparing each frame to the one
before it, so the first frame of a range has nothing to compare against and
reports stillness that is not there. A range therefore decodes from a little
before it starts and throws away what it produced before its own beginning.

The second is that the result is stated in the film's own time, not the
range's. A partial score whose cues are at 0s when they belong at 47 minutes
is a thing you have to remember to correct; one that says 47 minutes is just a
score that happens to be short. Everything downstream — merging, reading it by
hand, opening it in the studio — gets simpler for it.

    seconds on the first real chunk. Without the holding point the merged curve
    ramps from the previous chunk's last value to that one, inventing a slow
    slide through a stretch the film spent perfectly still. A cue gets no such
