 * about how much detail to draw — reads it. Keeping that in one place is what
 * makes the overview strip and the main surface agree by construction rather
 * than by two pieces of code doing the same arithmetic.
 *
 * The window is the reason the timeline can hold a feature film at all. A two
 * hour score is around 45,000 curve points; drawing all of them, all the time,
 * is what the previous timeline did and why it could not scale. Nothing off
 * screen is ever drawn.
