/* Edits, and taking them back.
 *
 * Every change to a score goes through a command, and every command knows how
 * to undo itself. Nothing anywhere else may reach in and set a `t`. That rule
 * is the whole reason this file exists: an editor without undo is not an
 * editor, because editing is trying things, and undo is only trustworthy if
 * there is exactly one way for the document to change.
 *
 * Commands hold *object references*, never indices. A score's cues and points
 * must stay sorted by time, so almost every edit re-sorts the array it touched
 * and every index into it goes stale immediately. Object identity survives a
 * sort; an index does not. This was the difference between an undo stack that
 * works and one that silently moves the wrong event.
