/* Reported as "I click insert at playhead and nothing shows on the timeline".
 *
 * A fog track added by hand is a curve track — addTrack makes curves — and
 * every fog preset carries an action, so the insertion was built as a cue and
 * written into a curve track. The timeline draws a curve from its points, so
 * nothing appeared. Worse than invisible: normalise refuses a curve track
 * carrying cues, so the score would not have saved either.
 *
 * The preset says what shape it is. The track says what it can hold. The track
 * wins.
