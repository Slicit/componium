 * to extend, makes every entry testable without a renderer, and means the
 * shapes can be drawn as thumbnails from the same data that builds the points.
 *
 * What it inserts is ordinary points and ordinary cues. There is no preset

 * shape in and then it is yours, which is the whole point of a starting shape.
