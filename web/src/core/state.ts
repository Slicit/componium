/* What every device is doing at a given moment.
 *
 * This mirrors the conductor: curve tracks interpolate, cue tracks are spans
 * that begin at their time and last for their duration. Deliberately a second
 * implementation rather than an API call, because the room redraws on every
 * animation frame and a round trip per frame would be absurd.
 *
 * Being a second implementation it can drift from the Go one, so the rules it
 * has to match are stated here and tested:
 *
 *   A curve holds at its endpoints rather than extrapolating.
 *   Linear interpolates between points; step holds the earlier value.
 *   A channel that stops being mentioned holds its last value.
 *   A cue with no duration is momentary.
