/* The library and the timeline have to agree, and this is what makes them.
 *
 * Reported as "I insert a Strobe and get one light event with no intensity and
 * no points". Three separate ways the same sentence can come true, all of them
 * a preset being mistranslated on the way into a track:
 *
 *   - a shape of twelve pulses collapsed into one cue, because an event device
 *     was assumed to want one dose;
 *   - the number landing in `r`, `g` and `b` on a track whose every other cue
 *     was written in `h`, `s` and `i`, because channels were read from points
 *     and a cue track has none;
 *   - the same number written into a hue as well as an intensity, because a
 *     channel was a channel.
 *
 * So the rule, and the reason this file exists rather than a comment: anything
 * the picker offers must insert, into the track it was offered for, something
 * that keeps the shape's pulses and lands in that track's own channels. Adding
 * a preset, a kind, or a channel vocabulary without honouring that fails here.
