/* Where every lane sits.
 *
 * One track can occupy one row or several: a colour curve expanded is three
 * channel lanes, collapsed it is a single ribbon. The header column and the
 * canvas have to agree about that down to the pixel, and the cheapest way to
 * guarantee it is to compute it once, here, and have both read the answer.
 *
 * No DOM, so it is testable — and worth testing, because "the labels are one
 * row out from the lanes" is the kind of defect that looks like a rendering
 * glitch and is actually two pieces of arithmetic disagreeing.
