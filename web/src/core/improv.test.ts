/* The firmware's protocol numbers, against the flasher's own.
 *
 * This exists because of a bug that could not be diagnosed from its symptom.
 * The firmware had the Improv RPC commands written from memory and every one
 * was a slot out: it read 2 as "identify" when 2 is "request current state".
 * The flasher asked what state the board was in, got silence, waited ten
 * seconds and reported no Improv support. Nothing else was wrong. There was
 * nothing in a log, nothing on the board, and nothing to see except a step in
 * a dialog that did not appear.
 *
 * A comment saying "these come from the spec" would not have helped, because
 * the first version had that comment. So the numbers are read out of both
 * sides and compared: `improv-wifi-serial-sdk` is what the flasher actually
 * uses, and it is a dev dependency for exactly this. If the SDK renumbers
 * anything, or somebody edits the firmware from recollection, this fails here
 * rather than on a bench with a board that will not talk.
