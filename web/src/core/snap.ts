/* Snapping.
 *
 * A dragged event lands on something meaningful rather than wherever the
 * pointer happened to be: a frame boundary, the playhead, or another event.
 * Without it every edit is off by a few milliseconds and the score fills up
 * with times nobody chose.
 *
 * The threshold is in *pixels*, not seconds, which is the part that is easy to
 * get wrong. A fixed time threshold snaps from half a screen away when zoomed
 * in and never fires when zoomed out; a fixed pixel distance behaves the same
 * at every zoom, which is what makes it feel like a tool rather than a
 * surprise.
