/* Turning a track into a drawing.

 *
 * Nothing off screen is drawn. That is what makes a two hour score — around
 * 45,000 curve points — possible at all, and every loop here starts by asking
 * the view whether the thing is visible.
 *
 * Amplitude is always visible. The previous timeline drew a cue as a fixed
 * block, so a gust at 0.2 and a gust at 1.0 were the same rectangle: it showed
 * *when* and never *how hard*, which is half of what a score says. Here an
 * event's height and fill both carry its amplitude, and its width carries its
 * duration, so a track reads as a bar chart of strength over time.
