/* The effects library, and a way to try one before you commit to it.

 * Preview is an action, not a consequence of looking. Choosing a preset used
 * to start it playing on an endless loop, which meant the room was showing the
 * preview instead of the score for as long as anything was selected — so the
 * moment you wanted to check the effect against what the timeline already had,
 * the preview was in the way of exactly that. It also meant the only way to
 * stop looking at it was to stop selecting it, and you have to keep selecting
 * it in order to insert it.
 *
 * So: picking selects, the play button previews, and a preview runs a fixed
 * number of times and stops on its own. Nothing keeps hold of a device.
