/* Icons, for the actions that have one.
 *
 * The rule, and it is a rule rather than a preference: an action with a
 * settled, universal icon gets the icon, never the word. Delete is a bin, save
 * is a disk, edit is a pencil — everybody already knows those, and spelling
 * them out costs a row of width to tell people something they can see faster.
 *
 * The other half of the rule matters more: an action WITHOUT a settled icon
 * gets a word. Rebuild, Prepare, Reset and Resume have no glyph anyone would
 * read the same way twice, and inventing one produces a row of little symbols
 * that all have to be hovered to be understood. A mixed row of icons and words
 * is not an inconsistency, it is the point — the icons are the actions you do
 * often and recognise instantly, the words are the ones worth reading.
 *
 * Drawn inline rather than pulled from a font or a package: five glyphs is not
 * worth a dependency, and an icon font that fails to load leaves squares.
