// @vitest-environment jsdom

/* When the timeline redraws.
 *
 * A draw is not free. Measured on a two hour score at the zoom people actually
 * review at — the whole film on screen — building one draw list costs about
 * five milliseconds, which is a third of a frame budget before the canvas has
 * rasterised anything. Zoomed in it is under one.
 *
 * So the question these ask is not "does it draw" but "does it draw when
 * nothing it draws has changed". The effect that runs it had no dependency
 * array, so it ran on every commit of the component: every unrelated piece of
 * app state, every slider drag somewhere else on the page, every poll of the
 * library, paid for a full rebuild of the timeline.
 *
 * The reason it was written that way is real and worth keeping in mind: the
 * view is a stable mutable object, so its identity never changes when the
 * window is panned or zoomed. Depending on the object would miss every scroll.
 * Depending on the two numbers it holds does not.
