/* The room, in three.js.
 *
 * The flat CSS view answers "which device is doing what". This one answers a
 * question the flat view cannot: "what would that feel like from the seat".
 * Wind has a direction and a spread. Fog pools on the floor and drifts. A
 * light spike throws colour onto the walls behind you and glints off the
 * furniture. None of that is legible as a marker on a plan, and all of it is
 * what a contributor needs to see before trusting a cue to a machine that
 * moves a person.
 *
 * It does not replace the flat view. Anything with a GPU gets this; anything
 * without falls back, and the fallback is a real view rather than an apology.
 *
 * Coordinates are the rig's, unchanged and in metres: origin at the centre of
 * the screen wall, x right, y up, z toward the audience. three.js uses the
 * same handedness, so there is no conversion anywhere in this file. That is
 * deliberate — a coordinate transform is a place for a sign error to hide, and
 * the rig file is the thing an operator edits by hand.
