// @vitest-environment jsdom

/* The room redraws when the score is edited.
 *
 * Commands mutate the score in place — they hold references to the tracks and
 * cues they act on, because every edit re-sorts the track — so the score object
 * handed to the room is the same object before and after an edit. An effect
 * watching only that object never runs again, and adding a cue at the playhead
 * changed nothing in the room until you scrubbed away and back. That reads as
 * the room being out of sync with the timeline, which is exactly how it was
 * reported.
 *
 * Room3D is a WebGL class jsdom cannot build, so these watch the seam it is
 * driven through instead: update() is called with a fresh scene state.
