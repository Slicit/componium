/* The room, as a component.
 *
 * Room3D is an imperative class that owns a WebGL context and a scene graph,
 * and it stays that way: React is a poor fit for something redrawn every frame
 * from mutable state, and rewriting it as components would trade a working
 * renderer for a fashionable one. This wrapper does the three things React is
 * actually good for here — mount it, feed it, and take it down again.
 *
 * three.js is loaded on demand. It is around 600KB, the timeline is what most
 * of this application is, and someone who never opens the room should not pay
 * for it on first load.
