/* What the model said, so a person can decide whether to pay for it again.
 *
 * The description has been written beside every score since the vision seam
 * existed and there has never been a way to look at it without a shell on the
 * box. Which is most of why the choice between reusing it and running it again
 * was never offered: the thing the choice is about was invisible, and "is this
 * description good enough" is not a question anybody can answer from a count of
 * cues in a timeline.
 *
 * So this is a reading room, and the expensive action lives at the bottom of
 * it — where it can be taken after looking rather than instead of looking.
