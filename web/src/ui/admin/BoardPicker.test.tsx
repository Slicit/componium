/* Choosing a board, and the ordering that makes it awkward.
 *
 * The picker mounts before the rig has loaded, so its address arrives after it
 * is already on screen. An address that turns out to match no board has to
 * appear then, or the entry shows a dropdown pointing at the wrong board while
 * the value the rig actually holds is invisible and uneditable.
 *
 * Mounted directly because that ordering cannot be produced through the page,
 * where every load is awaited before anything is asserted. Mutation testing is
 * what found the gap: hiding the field for a late address broke nothing.
