/* Arming the room, and telling it where the playhead is.
 *
 * The studio's playhead lives here and the rig lives in the server, so while
 * this is armed the page reports its position and the server drives the room
 * from it. Everything about timing is already on the other side: the clock
 * discipline, the latency compensation, the curve driver and the safety
 * supervisor are the same ones a show uses. This is a switch and a wire.
 *
 * Two things it does that are about safety rather than features.
 *
 * It reports while paused as well as while playing, a few times a second.
 * Silence has to mean "this page is gone" and nothing else, or a paused editor
 * would look identical to a closed tab and the server could not tell them
 * apart.
 *
 * It disarms on the way out. The server puts the rig away by itself after a
 * few seconds of silence, which is the guarantee; this makes closing the tab
 * immediate rather than eventual, and a fan that stops when you close the page
 * is worth the ten lines.
