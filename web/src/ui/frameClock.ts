/* The playhead, at the film's own frame rate.
 *
 * `timeupdate` is the obvious event and it is the wrong one. Every browser
 * throttles it to roughly four a second, which is fine for a clock readout and
 * useless for anything that has to line up with what is on screen: a strobe of
 * twelve pulses over two seconds is a 6Hz square wave, and sampling that four
 * times a second cannot reconstruct it at all. What you see is a handful of
 * flashes at arbitrary moments, landing differently on every pass. Nothing was
 * dropping frames; the room was being handed four light values a second and
 * drawing each one perfectly.
 *
 * `requestVideoFrameCallback` fires once per frame the browser actually
 * presents, and hands over that frame's own presentation time. That is the
 * film's clock rather than a sampling of it, which matters twice: the score
 * steps at the rate the film does, and it steps at the same instants the
 * picture does. The television and the room were already on that clock, since
 * three.js registers the same callback for its video texture. Only the score
 * was not.
 *
 * Animation frames are the fallback, which is the display's rate rather than
 * the film's — more often than needed for a 24p film and never less.
