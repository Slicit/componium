/* The wiring between the film, the playhead and the timeline.
 *
 * These exist because of a bug the rest of the suite could not see. The
 * playhead followed the film through an effect that reached for the video
 * element and called addEventListener — but the video element does not exist
 * until a film is picked, which happens after that effect has already run and
 * returned early. So the listener was never attached, the playhead stopped
 * following the picture, and every other test still passed: the core was
 * correct, the renderer was correct, and the two were simply not connected.
 *
 * That class of fault is invisible to a unit test of a pure function and to a
 * draw-list assertion. It needs the component actually mounted.
